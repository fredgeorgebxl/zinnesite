# ResponsiveImageBundle

The ResponsiveImageBundle adds the ability to easily created styled responsive images (scaled, cropped, greyscale) in Symfony3. 

Features include:

- Image objects are stored via Doctrine ORM
- Handles uploading images to a configurable directory or an s3 bucket. 
- Allows for images styles to be defined in configuration.
- Allows breakpoints and pictures sets to be configured
- Handles creation of styled images on the fly (as they are viewed) or viw events listeners
- Includes a widget to define an images crop and focus areas giving art direction to styled images.

Image styles can be defined easily:

```
thumbnail:
    effect: crop
    width: 180
    height: 180
```

Image styles can be grouped into 'picture sets', which are used to generate responsive images using the html5 '<picture>' element.
A picture set is a group of image styles with a breakpoint associated with each style.

First breakpoints are defined like so:

```
breakpoints:
    base: 'min-width: 0px'
    mobile: 'min-width: 300px'
    phablet: 'min-width: 480px'
    tablet: 'min-width: 768px'
    desktop: 'min-width: 1100px'
    tv: 'min-width: 1800px'
```

Then picture sets are defined using some or all of the defined breakpoints with defined styles or new styles:

```
thumb_picture:
    base:
        effect: crop
        width: 300
        height: 600
        greyscale: TRUE
    mobile:
        effect: crop
        width: 480
        height: 300
    phablet:
        effect: crop
        width: 400
        height: 700
    tablet:
        effect: crop
        width: 180
        height: 380
    # to use a pre-defined style just use its name as below
    desktop: thumb
    tv:
        effect: crop
        width: 300
        height: 500
```
The generated picture element would be like:

```
<picture>
    <source srcset="/uploads/documents/styles/thumb_picture-tv/example.jpg" media="(min-width: 1800px)">
    <source srcset="/uploads/documents/styles/thumb/example.jpg" media="(min-width: 1100px)">
    <source srcset="/uploads/documents/styles/thumb_picture-phablet/example.jpg" media="(min-width: 768px)">
    <source srcset="/uploads/documents/styles/thumb_picture-tablet/example.jpg" media="(min-width: 480px)">
    <source srcset="/uploads/documents/styles/thumb_picture-mobile/example.jpg" media="(min-width: 300px)">
    <source srcset="/uploads/documents/styles/thumb_picture-base/example.jpg" media="(min-width: 0px)">
    <img srcset="/uploads/documents/styles/thumb_picture-base/example.jpg" alt="Your alt text" title="Your title">
</picture>
```

1: Crop Focus
---------------------------

A custom formType is included which creates a 'crop and focus widget'. This widget allows users to select an area which is always cropped out of the image, and a focus area which is always included in the image.

<img src="/docs/images/cropfocuswidget.jpg" />

The black area will always be cropped out for all image styles. The inner rectangle will always be fully included in styled images. 
There are some combinations of styles dimensions and focus dimensions where its just not possible include the whole focus rectangle. 
In this case the largest possible portion of the focus rectangle is included.

For example the image below has a crop and focus applied to it using the widget:

<img src="/docs/images/gougou-widget.jpg" />

Images that have been cropped and scaled with various styles might look like this:

<img src="/docs/images/gougou-focus-cropped.jpg" />

If no focus or cropped were applied the images would be like this:

<img src="/docs/images/gougou-nocrop-focus.jpg" />

2: Installation
---------------------------

With composer
```
composer require irishdan/responsive-image-bundle
```

3: Enable the Bundle
-------------------------

Enable the bundle by adding it to the list of registered bundles
in the `app/AppKernel.php` file of your project:

```
<?php
// app/AppKernel.php

// ...
class AppKernel extends Kernel
{
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
            // ...

            new ResponsiveImageBundle\ResponsiveImageBundle(),
        );

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

Import the service definitions in to your config.yml file.
```php
    - { resource: "@ResponsiveImageBundle/Resources/config/services.yml" }
```

Import the routing in to routing.yml file.
```php
responsive_image:
    resource: "@ResponsiveImageBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml"
    prefix:   /
```


4: Configuration

                height: 600
            mobile:
                effect: crop
                width: 480
                height: 300
            tablet:
                effect: crop
                width: 400
                height: 700
            phablet:
                effect: crop
                width: 180
                height: 380
            desktop: thumb              # To use a pre-defined style just use its name
            tv:
                effect: crop
                width: 300
                height: 500
    crop_focus_widget:                  # Crop focus widget settings
        include_js_css: TRUE        # If true widget js css is included in the field html. Otherwise add it manually.
        display_coordinates: TRUE   # Toggles between a text field or hidden field.
    aws_s3:
        enabled: FALSE
        remote_file_policy: STYLED_ONLY # STYLED_ONLY, ALL
        temp_directory: 'tmp/' # will be created within the symfony directory
        protocol: 'http'
        bucket: 'bucket_name'
        region: 'eu-west-1'
        version: 'latest'
        directory: 'directory_name'
        access_key_id: KEY_ID
        secret_access_key: ACCESS_SECRET
```

Most Browsers do not yet support the <picture> tag. Therefore a polyfil is needed. This is available here http://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill
and is also included in the bundle at Resources/public/js/vendor/picturefill.js.


5: Usage
---------------------------

Generator is now included

For image objects you can use your own entity, as long as it implements the ResponsiveImageInterface
```
ResponsiveImageBundle\ResponsiveImageInterface.
```
don't for get jquery for the edit widget

```
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.4/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

When creating a new image the responsive_image.uploader service handles uploading and saving the image file to the server.
```
$this->get('responsive_image.uploader')->upload($image);
```

for exmaple:
```
class ResponsiveImageController extends Controller
{
    ...
    ...

    /**
     * Creates a new responsiveImage entity.
     *
     * @Route("/new", name="image_new")
     * @Method({"GET", "POST"})
     */
    public function newAction(Request $request)
    {
        $responsiveImage = new Responsiveimage();
        $form = $this->createForm('ResponsiveImageBundle\Form\ResponsiveImageType', $responsiveImage);
        $form->handleRequest($request);

        if ($form->isSubmitted() && $form->isValid()) {

            $this->get('responsive_image.uploader')->upload($responsiveImage);

            $em = $this->getDoctrine()->getManager();
            $em->persist($responsiveImage);
            $em->flush();

            return $this->redirectToRoute('image_show', ['id' => $responsiveImage->getId()]);
        }

        return $this->render('responsiveimage/new.html.twig', [
            'responsiveImage' => $responsiveImage,
            'form' => $form->createView(),
        ]);
    }

```

The easiest way tot generate styled images is to use the twig extensions in your templates.
```
{{ styled_image(image, 'image_style_name') }}
{{ picture_image(image, 'picture_set_name') }}
```
You can also generate background image css with media queries for each brak point in a picture set.
```
<style>
   {{ background_responsive_image(image, 'picture_set_name', '#header') }}
</style>
```

To generate a styled image tag elsewhere, simply set the image style using the responsive_image.style_manager service.
```
$this->get('responsive_image')->setImageStyle($image, 'image_style_name');
```
Or you can simply use the setStyle method on the $image object directly. In your template file, printing invokes the _toString method to generate the img tag.

```
{{ image }}
```

To generate a picture element the style manager service is used.
```
$this->get('responsive_image')->setPictureSet($image, 'picture_set_name');
```
Again, printing the object will generate the picture element html. If the style and the picture properties are both set the picture takes precedence.

To set the crop and focus areas of an image in your edit form use the the CropFocusType in the form builder.
```
$form->add('crop_coordinates', CropFocusType::class, array(
    'data' => $image
));
```

If not using AWS are generated on the fly if an image url is visited the and the styled file is not present. Visiting the url below will generate the image the first time.
On subsequent visits the file is served.

www.example.com/uploads/images/styles/thumb/example.jpg

note: 'uploads/images' can be set as image_directory in your configuration and 'styles' can be set as image_styles_directory in your configuration.

Events listeners are provided to allow image generation with your CRUD logic. 
For example if you wanted to generate all of the styled images after an edit form is submitted, you could use an event dispatcher:

```
// Dispatch style generate event to the listeners.
$event = new ImageEvent($image);
$this->dispatcher->dispatch(
    ImageEvents::IMAGE_GENERATE_STYLED,
    $event
);
```

Available listeners are:
```
// Generate styled images.
IMAGE_GENERATE_STYLED = 'responsive_image.image_generate_styled';

// Delete original and styled images for a given image object.
IMAGE_DELETE_ALL = 'responsive_image.image_delete_all';

//Delete original and styled images for a given image object.
IMAGE_DELETE_ORIGINAL = 'responsive_image.image_delete_original';

// Delete styled images for a given image object.
IMAGE_DELETE_STYLED = 'responsive_image.image_delete_styled';

```
